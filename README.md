## **Project Description:** 

In this project, I am going be replicating the deep learning model behind the 2017 paper [*PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequenctial Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06071) and adding further modelling experiments on my own.   When it was released, the paper presented a new dataset called PubMed 200k RCT which consists of ~200,000 labelled Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) abstracts.
